## [1.79.2] - 2026-04-08

**Truth + coverage foundation.** Parser log paths resolve through a layered
contract rooted in central distro config. Soak v1.79.1 untouched.

### Added
- Go distroconf reader package (BUG-15)
- 18 distro confs populated with mail/MTA/DA/FTP path keys (BUG-14) + CI gate
- `tools/refresh-osv-suppressions.sh` + weekly OSV refresh workflow
- v1.79.2 truth foundation plan, gap matrix, Go pipeline design, decommission roadmap

### Fixed
- BUG-2 — DA parser reads `login.log` + `security.log`
- BUG-4 — cPanel exim path via `exim -bP` fall-through
- BUG-5 — CLI banner = pure projection of validator JSON (INV-CONS-001)
- BUG-12 — postfix path via `postconf -h maillog_file`
- OSV CI gate — 6 newer stdlib CVEs suppressed under build-target policy
- gosec G204/G304 false positives annotated

### Changed
- `loginmon/module.go startFileWatchers` — 4-layer resolver (distroconf → tool → fallback → MISSING)
- CHANGELOG process — entry required before every tag

### Verification
Lab4 gates: `go build`, `go test`, `go vet`, `validate_distro_configs.sh` all pass.
Main CI on `41f64fd7`: 36/36 success.

### Refs
PR #350. v1.80 backlog: BUG-1, BUG-3, BUG-6, BUG-10, BUG-13 schema.
